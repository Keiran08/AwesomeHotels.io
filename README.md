# Brand identity

Awesome Hotels is a brand that is accessabile to all millenials.  A coveted brand that is also accessible to all. The generation that values inclusion needs to see that reflected back in the brands that they choose.  The brand will offer inclusive and experiential travel experiences.

# Mobile first

The website is viewable on all tested screen sizes.  This is due to the use of bootstrap, ensuring that the website will work on the move, wherever the user is travelling.

The images all resize according to the users screen size.  The desktop menu disapears and becomes a button that the user can hide, when the website is displayed on smaller screens.

# Logo

The logo is basic to keep the design modern.  The image of three suitcases is there to evoke travelling with friends.  Inving the user to make experiential traveling experience a shared one.   The logo uses the same font as the web page to create cohesion.

# Design choices

The design choices were influenced by market research that indicates that millenials are drawn to authentic and modern brands.  The website is clear and shows the companies values in the few images that it displays

This website provided some of the inspiration: (https://tjarksandtjarks.com/en/branding/designing-for-millennials/)
    

# Colours and fonts

The colours chosen were from this website: (https://www.ppgpaints.com/color/color-collections/generational-palettes/millennials) that suggested colours that millenials are drawn to.  The font used was 'Roboto'.  A font chosen to compliment the individuality of colors.  The website notes that millenials have a 'mistrust of brands' and are more influenced by their cohort.  This is why the image of the couple is included.  Millenials need to see other millenials using the service.  This is also why the links to various social media sites are included in the contact section of the page.
